WORK EXPERIENCE
Palat Technologies FPL India Pvt. Ltd Feb 2025-Present
QA Automation Executive Noida, India Hybrid
• Automated online ordering scenarios (pickup, dine-in, home delivery, gift cards) using Selenium and Playwright.
• Built automation flows for payment gateways (Stripe, Square, JCC Pay, Authorize.net) ensuring accurate payment
validation and order sync.
• Improved payment flow stability across multiple gateways, reducing transaction failures by 20%.
• Enhanced checkout modules (cart, saved cards, address) to minimize user drop-offs and improve order conversion.
• Performed API testing and automation for order placement, POS sync, and loyalty reward systems.
• Validated integrations with partner platforms (Toast, Clover, Uber Eats, Como) to maintain revenue accuracy.
• Debugged and analyzed client activity logs to resolve production bugs and ensure smooth live operations.
PROJECTS
World cup Data Analytics - Cricket Analysis | Python, Web scrapping, Pandas, Power BI
• Created a Power BI report to identify top 11 players for a T20 cricket team by scraping data from ESPNcricinfo
with a Brightdata website tool, cleaning and transforming the data with pandas, and evaluating various player
performance metrics.
• Used the resulting Power BI dashboard to select players for various categories (openers, middle order/anchors,
finishers, all-rounders, specialist fast bowlers) and ultimately choose the top 11 players to play in the match.
• Selected team using the Power BI dashboard has 90% of chances to win the game.Implemented A/B testing and
dashboards to track CTR (Click-Through Rate), latency, and zero-result rates.
Movie Recommendation System | Machine Learning, NLP, Python
• Content-based recommender for 5,000+ TMDB titles using Python and scikit-learn, delivering sub-second,
highprecision suggestions.
• Applied NLP (CountVectorizer, cosine similarity) to consolidate genres, cast, keywords, and achieving 95%+
accuracy in blind tests.
• Deployed Streamlit app with real-time TMDB API integration for dynamic poster display and user interaction.
• Managed end-to-end ML workflow: JSON parsing, feature engineering, model serialization, and web deployment.
Hybrid Search & Recommendation Engine | Elasticsearch, FastAPI, ML
• Combined BM25 keyword search with vector embeddings to improve relevance.
• Implemented personalized recommendations and typo-tolerant semantic queries.
• Implemented A/B testing and dashboards to track CTR (Click-Through Rate), latency, and zero-result rates.

Data Management Capstone Project with SUMOTO CROP SCIENCE COMPANY Dec 2024
• Customer segmentation analysis using clustering techniques, increasing customer retention by 22% and boosting
regionalsales revenue by 11%.
• Designed predictive models for demand forecasting, reducing inventory costs by 7 % .
• Implemented sales performance analytics, enhancing order prioritization and achieving a 15 % increase in high
potential sales conversions.
Order & Inventory Management System | Microservices, Kafka, FastAPI, PostgreSQL
• A microservices-based Order & Inventory system with Kafka event streaming, achieving sub-100ms processing.
• Designed REST APIs using FastAPI and Swagger UI, cutting integration effort by 40%.
• Automated dev and deployment using Docker Compose and Poetry, reducing setup time by 60%.
• A cloud-ready architecture deployable on AWS ECS (Elastic Container Service)/Kubernetes for horizontal scaling.
